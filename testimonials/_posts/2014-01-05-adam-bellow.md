"EdSurge is a wonderful resource that has it's finger on the pulse of educational technology. With a steady stream of articles and witty reporting that reaches thousands of inboxes each week, they dish the latest on trends, tools, the players, and other vital information that is essential for entrepreneurs and educators alike. I find EdSurge an invaluable go-to resource that is as fun to read as it is informational. If you're involved in education and are interested in technology, I strongly recommend incorporating EdSurge into your digital diet."
