EdSurge is an independent news and research company devoted to covering education technology and its role in schools. We began operations in 2011, with four cofounders: Elizabeth Corcoran, Nick Punt, Agustin Vilaseca and Matt Bowman. We provide regular newsletters, commentary, reports on products and trends, and analytical studies. Our coverage addresses the trends, companies, people and policies involved in education technology.

Our reputation for accurate, trustworthy coverage is our greatest asset. We believe our first and foremost responsibility is to our readers. All our business relationships are structured to avoid any conflicts with our readers’ interests. Specifically, we receive no income from linking to other sites or from sales of products online. We have no investments in other companies. We do not adjust editorial content according to the wishes – or the wallets -- of sponsors, partners or investors. In fact, we hurl buckets of ice water at anyone foolish enough to propose such a misguided idea. We don’t shy from covering subjects that might be sensitive issues for these organizations.

All our investors support journalistic independence; they do not attempt to influence our coverage. We have received grants from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to support the development of our website. In 2012, we raised seed funding from the NewSchools Venture Fund and Washington Post Co. We also received support from several independent angel investors, namely: Dale Dougherty, Judy Estrin, Gillian Munson and Nancy Peretsman. We will update this list quarterly as our business grows.

Our business model calls for us to earn revenue by publishing ads, organizing conferences and other events, and offering premium services such as subscriptions and reports. We clearly distinguish advertising from journalistic copy, in line with publishing’s best practices.

EdSurge’s journalists adhere to a strict conflict-of-interest policy on personal financial activity. Our journalists do not create advertising content or accept any gifts that might influence their coverage. Our journalists do not accept any expense reimbursement or junkets from vendor-sponsored groups. When we publish material written by outside contributors, we disclose relevant information about their backgrounds so that their point of view will be clearly explained.

Our staffers attend neutral-sponsor conferences on the same terms that are usually offered to the media, which may include speaker fees, reimbursement of travel costs (when we're participating as speakers) or a discounted/free press rate. (We define “neutral sponsors” as government agencies, universities, charitable groups or similar organizations that have no product to sell and no commercial agenda to push.) We disclose any such terms in our subsequent coverage of these events.

We recognize that no set of guidelines can address every issue that may arise in the course of doing business, especially given the pace of change within the media industry. That means these guidelines will be revisited and updated from time to time. We are all about learning and aim to be open to suggestions, criticism, and corrections from you, our community.
