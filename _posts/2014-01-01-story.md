title: Who We Are
---

Teacher, techies, storyteller.

EdSurge was started in 2011 by Betsy Corcoran, Matt Bowman, Nick Punt and Agustin Vilaseca to connect the emerging community of edtech entrepreneurs. We also wanted to give educators detailed information about what new technologies can--and cannot--do.

We report on latest news and trends in the edtech industry to help:

* Entrepreneurs who build new products and businesses;
* Educators who try these tools;
* Investors and others who support companies and schools.

We are also building a database of rich information about emerging products and how they’re being used. And we run a series of conferences where educators and entrepreneurs meet on common ground and exchange feedback on how to build and refine tools to improve educational outcomes.

With the right fools, technology can transform “learning” from something we did in classrooms at fixed hours of the day to something we can do anywhere, anytime.
