Leonard spends his time empathizing and prototyping with school administrators to better support their edtech decision-making process. He took a leave of absence in the summer of 2013 to serve as co-architect and designer-in-residence for the ESI School Design Fellowship -- a NYC Department of Education initiative to rethink high schools for at-risk black and Latino males. Leonard holds a MA from the Stanford Graduate School of Education in Learning, Design, and Technology; and a BS in Mechanical Engineering from Duke University.
