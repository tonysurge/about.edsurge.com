Nick is responsible for the product design and strategy behind EdSurge. Nick was most recently the VP of Products at [Uversity](http://www.uversity.com/), developing private social networks for students in post-secondary institutions. Prior to that, Nick co-founded [Socialfly](http://www.social-fly.com/), a Facebook/iPhone app designed to help you be 'twice the friend in half the time', and spent 3 years as a video games designer at [Pandemic Studios](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic_Studios). Nick became interested in education while sitting in after school in his mom's speech therapy lab, noticing the disparity between the quality of the computer games he loved and what was available for learners. Nick is a graduate of Stanford's MBA/MA Education program.
